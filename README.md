# Introduction - Aim
Project for Embendded Systems

  In the beginnig of Embendded Systems course, we were assigned the following project "Building an autonomous vehicle - Line Follower" where the vehicle should be able to follow a black line and also should be able to follow a path as fast as possible in order to beat the other vehicles. 
  
  
# Concept
  The concept is based on the IR Infrared Sensors and the way the reflect with light by the white color of the surface. Specifically, during the reflection, the motors are programmed to rotate and while they point on the black light, motors stop rotation.  
To ensure the smooth running of the vehicle, both on straight track and the curved one, we used the reflection of each sensor in proportion to the movements of the motors. 

# Construction
  The project is based on the new board 'Maker Pi RP2040'. 
  The total cost of this project - including transport- was 38euros and the list of costruction materials consists of: the Maker Pi RP2040 board, a Robot Car Kit (includes 1xCar chassis, 2xGear Motor(1:48), 2xSpeed encoder4xFasteners, 1xUniversal wheel, 1xPower button, 14xScrew, 1xBattery box, 10xNut), 3xMale to male connector wires, 3xIR infrared sensors and 4xBattery(1.5V each)
